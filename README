Carpod
======

Carpod automates the creation of playlists containing your currently favourite
albums so they can easily accessed on car iPod adapters which treat the iPod
as a CD multi-changer, like the Audi Concert with the iPod interface does.

From the Audi concert operating manual, about the iPod inteface :

"The sound system allocates the playlists on the iPod to disc numbers CD 1
to CD5.  The playlists are allocated first in numerical order then in
t;alphabetical order.  The easiest way to use playlists on the car's
entertainment system is to create five playlists on the iPod (e.g. 1 to 5.)

"If you select disc number CD 6, all the tracks on the iPod will be played
even if they are stored in different playlists.  Hoever, if you select an
artist, track, album or podcast before connecting the iPod, this selection
will not be changed until the next time you change the CD.

If your iPod adapter works like this, Carpod might be for you.

Carpod is written for, and will only work with, OS X.  It's only been tested
on Leopard 10.5.7.

Getting Carpod
--------------

You can get the source from http://github.com/carldr/carpod/tree/master.

You can also get a binary (Which won't be too far behind the repository) and
a pre-built EyeTunes framework from http://github.com/carldr/carpod/downloads.
You need to put EyeTunes.framework (uncompressed) in ~/Library/Frameworks.  You
can run Carpod from wherever you like.

Before you run Carpod, you need to make it executable :

% cd /path/to/where/carpod/is
% chmod +x carpod
% ./carpod your_last_fm_username

Building From Source
--------------------

You'll need to get hold of EyeTunes from http://code.google.com/p/eyetunes/,
and build it, and put the resultant framework in ~/Library/Frameworks.  (Or
get the pre-built binary as above.)

Then build carpod.  You'll end up with a command line utility in
build/Release.  Put it somewhere your shell will find it.

Running Carpod
--------------

Carpod should be ran from a terminal, and takes one argument - A last.fm
username, which Carpod will then interrogate to find the top five albums
that that user has listened to in the past three months.

Carpod will then create playlists numbered '- 1' to '- 5', and add those
albums to those playlists with the most listened to album in playlist '- 1'.
The albums need to be in your iTunes playlist.  For this reason, when you're
asked for a username, it's probably best to use your own.

The playlists are named '- 1' etc to ensure that they sort before playlists named
things like '1980s', like I have.

Make sure the new playlists sync to your iPod, and sync them.  Then get in your
car and rock the fuck out.

More Information
----------------

Carpod makes use of Scrobble, a as-yet unreleased framework for accessing
Last.fm's API in Cocoa.  The version included here doesn't support API calls
which require authentication.

Carpod also makes use of json-framework, and is distributed with Carpod.
You can find more information about the JSON library at
http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/
